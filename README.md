# Spellify

Spellify is a simple web-app built with NextJS, designed to improve
comprehension skills. It uses the native voice synthesis api present
on the Browser and generates spelling prompts in which the user has to listen to the generated word and spell it correctly.

The user must choose between three levels of difficulty:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

The number of prompts and lengths of words increases with each difficulty level. The user can see their score, and their spelling accuracy. The user can also practice incorrect words and hone their spelling.
